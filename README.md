# Extractive-Text-Summarization

In  this  new  era, where tremendous  information  is  available  on  the  internet, it  is  most  important  to provide the improved mechanism to extract the information quickly and most efficiently . It is very difficult for human beings to manually extract the   summary of  a  large  documents  of text. There are plenty of   text material available on  the  internet.  So  there  is  a  problem   of  searching  for  relevant  documents  from  the number of documents  available, and absorbing  relevant information from  it. In  order to solve  the  above two problems,  the  automatic  text summarization  is  very  much  necessary. Text  summarization   is  the  process of identifying  the  most   important  meaningful   information  in  a  document  or  set  of  related  documents  and compressing them into a shorter version preserving its overall meanings.

# Proposed System
The aim is to auto summarize documents. The proposed system works on the extractive summarization based approach, the system calculates the frequency weightage of each word in the sentence in the entire document and also validates for the parts of speech of the words then assigns a total score for the sentences. System then incorporates the clustering technique for extracting the final summary sentences.
